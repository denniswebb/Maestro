Analyze the conversation history below and generate a concise tab name (max 5 words, 40 characters).

Rules:
- Focus on the main topic or goal of the conversation
- Use title case (e.g., "Fix Authentication Bug")
- Omit common prefixes like "Implement", "Fix", "Add" unless critical for clarity
- If multiple topics, choose the most recent or important one
- Return ONLY the tab name in your response, nothing else
- If the conversation is too short or unclear, return "Conversation"
