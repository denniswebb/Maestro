Analyze the conversation history below and generate exactly 3 concise tab name suggestions.

Rules:
- Each suggestion should be max 5 words and 40 characters
- Focus on the main topic or goal of the conversation
- Use title case (e.g., "Fix Authentication Bug")
- Omit common prefixes like "Implement", "Fix", "Add" unless critical for clarity
- If multiple topics, provide variety: most recent, most important, and most descriptive
- Return ONLY the 3 tab names, one per line, nothing else
- If the conversation is too short or unclear, provide generic but helpful suggestions like "Recent Conversation", "Development Session", "Code Review"
